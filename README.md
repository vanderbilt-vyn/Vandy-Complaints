# VU Voice

Through VU Voice, we hope to create an open platform where students and administration can freely communicate their thoughts/initiatives. We found that 90.2% of students surveyed believe that such an app would help bridge the communication gap. More specifically, we aim to provide the following: 

1) For students: 
- A quick and effective way to voice their suggestions and complaints.
- A highly-visible forum that assures students their opinions are being heard.

2) For administration:
- A channel where administration can promptly respond to studentsâ€™ concerns and communicate the current initiatives/resources that are available to address those concerns. 
- A centralized platform for direct and honest feedback from students.
